# Sequencer and (Midi) Editor

Uses nw.js for the editor. nw can be downloaded from here:

https://nwjs.io/

It's preferable to use the sdk version to see the commands exchanged between pd and nw.
Console can be opened by F12.

Open sequencers_example.pd and follow the instructions. More information will be added soon.

Works with Purr Data, tested on win7/win10, will work with pd vanilla soon.
